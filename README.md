# 42 C++ Modules (Days 00 - 09)

This repository contains all the C++ modules from day 00 to day 09 as part of the 42 curriculum. Each module introduces key C++ concepts through structured exercises designed to strengthen programming skills.

## Modules Overview
- **Day 00**: Introduction to C++, namespaces, I/O streams, and basic syntax.
- **Day 01**: Memory allocation, references, and pointers.
- **Day 02**: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operators overloading.

- **Day 04**: Abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism.
- **Day 05**: Exception handling and proper error management.
- **Day 06**: C++ casts (implicit, explicit, reinterpret, etc.).
- **Day 07**: Templates and generic programming.
- **Day 08**: STL (Standard Template Library), iterators, algorithms.
- **Day 09**: Function pointers and callbacks.
